# Company Bankruptcy Prediction
This project aims to predict company bankruptcy by applying machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers. The project explores different design choices, compares model performance, and analyzes time-space complexity to determine the most effective approach for this classification task.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict company bankruptcy using a dataset of financial and operational metrics. By leveraging SVM and Random Forest classifiers, this project investigates:
* **Model Performance**: How different models and parameter choices impact prediction accuracy.
* **Time-Space Complexity**: The tradeoff between the computational time required to fit models and their performance.
* **Key Predictors**: Identifying the most significant factors contributing to a company's bankruptcy risk.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various financial ratios, credit ratings, and other relevant indicators. These features are analyzed to understand their impact on a company's likelihood of bankruptcy.
## Project Structure
### Part 1: Modeling with Original Data
1. **Random Forest Classifier**:
* Fit the model using default parameters and assess performance.
* Experiment with different non-default parameters, evaluate the model using selected metrics, and determine which configuration performs best.
* Compare the CPU time required for fitting different models and discuss the tradeoffs between model complexity and performance.
* Examine the decision rules generated by the model and identify the most important features for classification.
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
* Fit the model with default parameters and analyze the results.
* Change the kernel function from "rbf" to "linear" and evaluate the impact on model performance.
* Compare the CPU fitting times for different kernels and assess how these changes affect prediction accuracy.
### Part 2: Modeling with Undersampled Data
* Fit both the Random Forest and SVM models on an undersampled version of the dataset to address potential class imbalance.
* Compare the fitting times and performance metrics of both models on the undersampled data to determine the most effective approach.
## Tools and Technologies
* **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.
* **Scikit-learn**: For implementing and evaluating the SVM and Random Forest models.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and results.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis process.
## Results
This project provides a detailed comparison of SVM and Random Forest models, highlighting the tradeoffs between model accuracy and computational cost. The findings can guide future efforts in predicting company bankruptcy and similar classification tasks.
## Conclusion
By experimenting with different machine learning models and parameters, this project sheds light on the critical factors influencing bankruptcy prediction. The insights gained can help in building more accurate and efficient predictive models for financial risk assessment.
